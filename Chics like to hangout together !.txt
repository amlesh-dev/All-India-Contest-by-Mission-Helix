In a club ; there are B boys ; and G girls, and the girls would like to sit together in a row. That is ; between any two girls ; there should not be any boys between them.

Find in how many ways ; can this seating arrangement be done ; such that all girls always sit together. Note ; that all boys and all girls have to be seated.

Since the answer may be huge ; print it modulo 10^9+7.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Then T lines follow.

Each of those T lines contain two space seperated integers G and B ; denoting the number of Girls and Boys respectively.

Constraints
1<=T<=10^5
0<=G,B<=10^6

Output Format

For each test case ; in a single line ; print the number of permutations satisfying the given conditions.

Sample Input 0

1 2
4 2
2 4
Sample Output 0
